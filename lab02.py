# STEP 1

print("What is the bird's initial velocity?")
# Get the bird's initial velocity as input


print("What is the bird's launch angle in degrees?")
# Get the bird's launch angle as input

# Convert launch angle from degrees to radians


print("What is the height of the slingshot in feet?")
# Get the height of the slingshot as input


# Calculate the duration of the flight in seconds


# Calculate the maximum horizontal distance


# Calculate the maximum height


# Print out the calculated metrics like below. Replace X with the calculated numbers. Shorten the numbers to 2 significant figures (0.02, 12.44, etc.)
    # Duration of flight: X seconds
    # Bird's maximum horizontal distance: X feet
    # Bird's maximum height: X feet
    # The duration of the bird's flight in seconds
    # The bird's maximum possible horizontal distance


# STEP 2

print("Enter the x-coordinate of the pig:")
# Get the pig's x-coordinate as input


print("Enter the y-coordinate of the pig:")
# Get the pig's y-coordinate as input


# Calculate the straight-line distance from the bird & slingshot to the pig


# Print it out as below. Replace X with the calculated numbers. Shorten the numbers to 2 significant figures (0.02, 12.44, etc.)
    # Straight-line distance to the pig: X feet


# Calculate the time when the bird is directly over the pig (x1, y1)


# Calculate the y-position of the bird at the time it is directly over pig



# Print it out as below. Replace X with the calculated numbers. Shorten the numbers to 2 significant figures (0.02, 12.44, etc.)
    # The bird will be over the pig at time X seconds. The bird will be X feet above the pig.



# STEP 3

print("Enter the time in seconds to calculate the bird's position:")
# Get the time as input


# Calculate the x and y coordinates of the bird at the inputted time


# Print the results like below. Replace X & Y with calculated numbers. Shorten the numbers to 2 significant figures (0.02, 12.44, etc.)
    # Coordinates of bird at X seconds: X, Y
